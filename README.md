### Project Title: **Student Grades Management System**

#### Description:
This program manages student grades for a small class. It allows the user to:

1. **Input Student Data**: Enter names and grades for up to 10 students.
2. **Display Data**: Show the list of students with their grades.
3. **Calculate Average**: Compute and display the average grade.
4. **Find Highest and Lowest Grades**: Identify and display the highest and lowest grades along with student names.
5. **Sort Students by Grades**: Sort and display students based on their grades in descending order.

### Key Features:
- Uses arrays (lists) to store student names and grades.
- Includes basic error handling for grade inputs.

### Example Output:
After entering data, the program displays student grades, average grade, highest and lowest grades, and a sorted list of students. 

This project is a great way to practice working with arrays and basic programming concepts!
